Data structure:
  Option 1: have a dictionary for the instruments
  (key: instrument_id, value: instrument instance),
  and a separate dictionary for the users
  (key: user_id, value: user instance).

  pro:
  separating dictionary and instruments as two dictionaries make it easy to be:
  1. Agile programming:  easy to maintain, adaptive planning, flexible to change
  2. access friendly to each dictionaries separately
  3. more readable for other programmers
  cons:
  more codes

  Option 2: have one dictionary for both users and instruments
  E.g. user dictionary with an entry for instruments for each user.

  pro: easy to manage data per user, there is no need to generate entire separately
  cons:
  1. relatively hard to decode since the structure is more complicated;
  2. hard to read what's exactly inside the dictionary for other programmers.

  My reasons to choose option 1:
  1. there are more practices for me to mutate data in dictionary,
  2. get a chance to learn how to generate unique id string using: https://pynative.com/python-generate-random-string/
  or using a counter as the entries for each dictionary
